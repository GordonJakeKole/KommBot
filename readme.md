# KommBot (or Gordon's Bot)
Or, how I don't have to restart the bot every time something goes wrong or I change the config.

## Last time on Kommbot:
Well, it was working pretty well. A couple things bothered me. Mainly, the fact that to restart the Twitter stream, or to change anything really, I have to take down the whole bot and boot it back up (which isn't a problem when it's on my computer, but can get annoying when it's on the cloud I think).

## New with this update
With the change comes a good chunk of new commands to add Twitter accounts, delete them, and to restart the stream. Things still get dicey when it comes to not getting rate limited by Twitter, but as long as I don't shake things up too much I won't get 420'd.

## Going forward
Mission complete. The bot does literally everything I wanted from it. I'm going to put it on the cloud and enjoy my stream of translated KanColle news. Of course, the bot is pretty simple, so if there's something else I want a bot to do, I might just push another extension.
